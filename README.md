- 👋 Hi, I’m @vitesh13
- I am a materials scientist, who got introduced to coding during my PhD which was in area of computational materials science. 
- 👀 I’m interested in open source materials science softwares, crystal plasticity, microstructure evolution models. 
- 👀 On a more programming side - I am interested in developing softwares for calculating different material properties and developing different visualization tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++. Other than that I am good at FORTRAN and Python. However, as they say we can never say we are good enough at programming, so I am always trying to find new ways to code or learn new coding concepts. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on usage of DAMASK (@eisenforschung/DAMASK) and SCORE (@mkuehbach/SCORE)

- If anyone is further interested to use DAMASK, SCORE and want to learn more about these softwares, you can get in touch with me.
